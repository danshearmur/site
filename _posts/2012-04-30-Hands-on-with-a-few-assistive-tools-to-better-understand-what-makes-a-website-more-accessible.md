title: Hands on with a few assistive tools to better understand what makes a website accessible

I remember sitting down and reading my first XHMTL and CSS tutorial, which stated the benefit screen readers would get from semantic markup and CSS layouts. This of course was from a long time ago, when the web standards movement was just getting started, and sprawling nested tables used for layout were the norm.

Over the years I'd read about good techniques and practices that I was under the impression helped assistive tools such as screen readers or screen magnifiers. But at the same time I hadn't tried any of them, so how can you really know what the outcome will be? I really feel that any good designer/front ender needs to expereince using these assistive tools for themselves!

Once upon a time these assistive technologies were really expensive bits of software that would cost more than the latest version of Photoshop! So it wasn't all that available to your average web developer, thankfully this isn't the case anymore and I'm just going to run through using a couple of free ones.

# VoiceOver on MacOS X

MacOS X comes with a highly regarded untegrated suite of assistive tools. [VoiceOver](http://www.apple.com/accessibility/voiceover) is the screen reader and will work with any piece of Mac software. 

To enable VoiceOver type `cmd + f5` and at the dialog hit `enter` or alternatively you can follow the useful VoiceOver tutorial before you start. I would highly recommend using moving your screen so that you can't see it or,  I have found it really disconcerting, especially as I can't hear as fast as I type, so I have to make concious effort to slow down.


# NVDA for Windows


# Notes on using a screenreader
* It's all keyboard based navigation of pages
* Lots of interesting work being done with the newer HTML5 semantic elements and also the WAI-ARIA

## Rounding up

If you don't have a couple hours to spend installing software and trying these tools out first hand, there are a number of videos available to you:

Next week I will write another post detailing what's worth implementing now in your code.
